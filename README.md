#  League Matchup Notes

A minimalist desktop app built with Electron for ranked League of Legends players who want to **reflect, learn, and grow** by tracking their experiences in specific champion matchups.

Rather than writing generic game notes, this tool organizes your thoughts by **your champion vs your lane opponent**, allowing you to revisit learnings and track improvement over time.
